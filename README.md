## 🌐 Multi-language Support Implementation

### Overview
We've implemented comprehensive internationalization (i18n) support using React i18next, enabling seamless translation between English and Hindi across the entire portfolio website.

### Features
- **Complete Translation Coverage**: All content including navigation, page content, skill names, company details, and project descriptions
- **Dynamic Language Switching**: Instant language change without page reload
- **Persistent Language Selection**: User's language preference is saved in localStorage
- **Native Language Display**: Shows language names in their native script (English, हिंदी)
- **Location-based Suggestions**: Automatically suggests languages based on user's location

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **i18n Configuration**
- Configured React i18next with language detection and localStorage persistence
- Set up fallback language (English) for missing translations
- Enabled interpolation for dynamic content

#### 2. **Translation Structure**
```json
{
  "nav": { "home", "about", "experience", "skills", "contact" },
  "home": { "greeting", "name", "subtitle", "cta" },
  "about": { "title", "description", "expertise" },
  "skills": { "names", "aitools", "competencies" },
  "experience": { "companies", "projects" },
  "contact": { "form", "info", "country" }
}
```

#### 3. **Language Selector Component**
- **Minimal Design**: Shows only language name with dropdown arrow
- **Hover Effects**: Border appears only on hover for cleaner look
- **Grouped Controls**: Language selector grouped with dark mode toggle
- **Responsive**: Adapts to mobile and desktop layouts

#### 4. **Hindi Translations**
- **Technical Terms**: Properly translated (React → रिएक्ट, Python → पायथन)
- **Company Names**: Localized while maintaining recognition
- **Navigation**: Contextually appropriate Hindi terms
- **UI Elements**: All buttons, placeholders, and messages translated

#### 5. **Key Implementation Details**
```javascript
// Translation hook usage
const { t } = useTranslation();

// Dynamic content translation
<h1>{t('home.greeting')}</h1>

// Array-based content
experiences.map(exp => t(`experience.companies.${exp.id}.name`))

// Skill names with icon mapping
{ name: t('skills.names.reactjs'), iconKey: "React JS" }
```

### Language Coverage
- **English**: Complete coverage with professional terminology
- **Hindi**: Full translation including:
  - Navigation menu items
  - Page titles and descriptions
  - Technical skill names
  - AI tool descriptions
  - Company and project details
  - Form fields and validation messages
  - Country names (India → भारत)

### User Experience
1. **Seamless Switching**: Click language selector to instantly change language
2. **No Page Reload**: All content updates dynamically
3. **Consistent State**: Language preference persists across sessions
4. **Clean UI**: Borderless button design with hover effects

### Future Enhancements
The implementation is scalable to add more languages:
1. Add new locale file (e.g., `es.json` for Spanish)
2. Register language in i18n configuration
3. All components automatically support new language
